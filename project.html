                        <p>Star Ballz marked my debut as a game developer on Android and the Google Play Store. Back then, I was just 16, in my school days when I decided to dive into game creation using the Unity Game Engine.
                             I had only recently started learning Unity when I embarked on this project, so you could say that making Star Ballz was my journey of learning the ropes.<br><br>
                            Star Ballz is all about physics puzzles and arcade fun. 
                            In the game, you draw lines to guide a ball into smashing stars. 
                            It offers a range of game modes to keep you entertained, along with some unique levels and gameplay mechanics. 
                            The main goal is to draw lines that leverage physics to steer the ball towards a star, completing the level.<br><br>                           
                            Initially, when I released Star Ballz, it had just two game modes and 40 challenging levels. 
                            Admittedly, the difficulty curve was a bit steep. 
                            However, a few months down the road, I rolled out a major update packed with exciting new features and improvements.<br><br>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
                            Bully Us was a game that drew heavy inspiration from Among Us, 
                            essentially taking the concept of Among Us and giving it a school-themed twist. 
                            I had previously enjoyed playing the party game Mafia, and I saw Among Us as essentially a space-themed version of Mafia. 
                            This sparked the idea of creating a similar game.<br><br>
                            My first venture into multiplayer game development, assisted by YouTube and "Tom Weiland." 
                            Despite being a personal project for YouTube, I completed it in just three weeks, including all assets from scratch.<br><br>
                            Bully Us follows a concept similar to Among Us, but instead of imposters, 
                            the game features bullies whose sole objective is to vandalize school property and confront other students. 
                            The innocent students must complete various tasks and clean up the mess created by the bullies. 
                            To add an intriguing twist, I introduced a security guard who patrols the school at night, and everyone must avoid getting caught by him. 
                            If he does spot something suspicious, a meeting is called, and someone has to, well, leave (Don't ask where!).<br><br>
                            Regarding the game's development, I opted for a similar art style to that of the Among Us developers at Innersloth, 
                            as I was a big fan of the stickman Henry games they created. 
                            I also incorporated a variety of tasks, including playing the drums and solving math problems.<br><br>
                            For more information about the development process, you can check out the Devlog.

                        <p>
                            Initially, I created a video animation parody that featured a developer battling a stick figure within the Unity Game Engine, drawing heavy inspiration from Alan Becker's "Animation vs. Animator" (which I absolutely adored as a kid).<br> 
                            Interestingly, someone left a comment on that YouTube video, challenging me to create a game like it. I found the challenge intriguing.<br><br>
                            Thus, I set out to develop a game where you'd typically operate Windows, but something goes awry, eventually leading to a showdown with a stickman. 
                            There's a certain lore attached to the game, and I won't divulge more about the story to avoid spoilers. 
                            It was my first attempt at creating a game with a progressive storyline.<br><br>
                            The most significant challenge I faced was recreating the Windows interface within the Unity Game Engine while making it look believable. 
                            This task consumed a considerable amount of time, but I managed to accomplish it, at least for the most part.<br> 
                            For the remaining bits, I introduced custom error popups that, in my opinion, seamlessly integrated into the story—no slacking involved, 
                            I promise. Additionally, I implemented various interactions with the stickman.<br><br>

                        <a href="https://aeroblizz.itch.io/monke-together-strong" class="info-btn" target="_blank">Play Here</a>
                        <p>
                            Monke Together Strong was a game created for the Brackeys Game Jam 2021.<br><br>
                            The challenge was to develop a game within a week, 
                            centered around the theme "Stronger Together." 
                            Despite initially missing the first two days, I had just five days to complete the project. 
                            Surprisingly, it turned out quite well, and I felt satisfied with what I had accomplished. 
                            That's the essence of Game Jams – pushing yourself to the limit, 
                            sacrificing sleep, 
                            and gaining valuable learning experiences 
                            (although I might think twice about participating again).<br><br>
                            Upon hearing the theme, my mind kept circling back to the idea of monkeys. 
                            So, I came up with Monke Together Strong. <br>
                            The game features five monkeys, each with their unique special abilities. 
                            However, one monkey alone can't complete a level, 
                            requiring cooperation among them to progress. 
                            It's a 2D platformer with intriguing puzzles. 
                            For more details, you can watch the Devlog on the left.<br><br>

                        <h2>(Unreal Environment)</h2>
                        <p>
                            Abandoned Area represents my inaugural foray into environmental projects, 
                            crafted using Unreal Engine 5's cutting-edge technologies, including Lumen, Nanite, and Megascans. <br><br>
                            Originally, this map concept was intended for my upcoming multiplayer shooter, also being developed in Unreal Engine. 
                            However, I felt compelled to explore environment and level design, 
                            inspired by the stunning visuals showcased in Quixel and UE5 videos.  <br>
                            This project turned out to be a tad ambitious, considering it was my first venture into this realm. 
                            Surprisingly, it exceeded my expectations, taking approximately three weeks to complete. <br><br>
                            While this concept was initially designed with the intention of becoming a map for my shooter game, 
                            it's important to note that it doesn't represent the final map. 
                            Instead, I conceptualized it as a valuable reference for future map development. 
                            The actual map will likely be expansive and set in a similar forest environment, 
                            possibly featuring these same buildings.<br><br>
                            I hope you enjoy this cinematic presentation. All the shots are raw image sequences directly from Unreal Engine, 
                            without any post-compositing (although the images below may have some color grading applied).

                        <p>
                            Larry's Propechy is a game which is inspired by the popular game Hogwarts Legacy. <br><br>
                            So I started creating a 2D version of Hogwarts Legacy with pixel art graphics with Unity
                            game engine. <br>
                            It features a Harry Potter-like protagonist and different levels set in a forest and
                            Hogwarts.
                            The player has access to several spells, including a fire spell, an explosion spell, an
                            instant kill spell, and a healing spell.
                            The game includes several enemies and obstacles that the player must overcome to progress
                            through the levels.<br><br>
                            This game was made fairly quickly as I didn't want to create a fully fledged. It was just
                            for a youtube video, but I did added some of the essential game juice
                            like Camera shake, coyote jump etc. to make the game feel better.<br>
                            The game is free to play and available for download on itch.io. You can also click Play Here
                            from above to try out for yourself.

                            So I started making a a 2D Pixel Game.<br>
                            The sole reason of starting this Game was my liking of the Pixel Art, those Retro Pixel
                            games makes me Nostalgiac,
                            So I also wanted to make one.<br><br>
                            I decided to make this a Survival RPG kinda Game something like the combination of Stardew
                            Valley and Minecraft.
                            The game will have an Infinite Procedurally generated World, and you can build things, Do
                            Stuff and Yeah all those Sandbox things.<br>
                            Also the game will be a Multiplayer one.<br><br>
                            This is my Second Big Project (After the Endless Runner) which I am working on side by side
                            with Another Projects.
                            It's my one of the Mainstream Project, So it will take some time to develop, but don't worry
                            It will be Completed (99.9% Sure),
                            So Stay Tuned by watching Progress on this Game.<br><br>
                            Devlogs Playlist on the Left Side, I Hope you Like.

                        <p style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
                            This was my first Big Indie Project, Although it's an Endless Runner, and the Generic
                            Endless Runners are you know,
                            Same Repetition of Level Segments and just Running and Dodging, But this Game is a Different
                            Story.<br>
                            Speaking of Story, it's actually a Story Game and I am making this Game kind of a Story
                            Adventure Runner, where you can do Cool Parkour Moves,
                            Enemies, Traps and a lot of Great Stuff<br><br>
                            The main Idea of the Game is that you as a Protagonist will be able to Travel around the
                            World, and the rest of the things will be clear
                            when the Game comes out, Otherwise it would count as a Spoiler!.<br><br>
                            This game is also being developed side by side by the Pixel Survival Game, I am working on
                            two different games at same time because
                            it makes development more fun, it's like when you are bored with one type of game and you
                            want to make something different, So whenever I don't
                            feel like working on this Title, I can work on others. (maybe it's just my way of
                            Procrastinating).<br><br>
                            Anyways if you want to know more about this Project, You can watch Devlogs on my Channel,
                            also Playlist on the Left.

                            The concept of Time Travelling is very interesting and also Confusing,
                            But how can this be achieved in a Game.<br><br>
                            Well Time Travelling can be an integrated part of the story or the lore of the game,
                            which you can show by just changing the world, objects, and all that things.<br>
                            But wouldn't this be interesting to make everything around you gets reversed over time
                            which you can just watch the changes happening in front of you.<br><br>
                            Well that's Time Manipulation, So I made a mechaninsm for maybe my future games where
                            everything
                            around the Player get's reversed back in time.<br><br>

                            The Concept of this Project was to make a Generic Player Controller which works for every
                            Character in the Game<br><br>
                            And you can also change the character in runtime by aiming towards any player,<br>
                            Something like a ghost who is trying to possess people around it.<br><br>
                            There's an Idea of making a Multiplayer game by this mechanism which I will work on soon.But
                            for now this is what I made,
                            I tried to make it as seamless as possible just like a spirit who is trying to possess an
                            NPC.<br><br>
                            You can watch the Devlog which Explains how I made this and I hope you you find it
                            interesting.<br><br>
