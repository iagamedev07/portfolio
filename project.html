                        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NeoSparX.StarBallz">Play Here</a>
                        <p>Star Ballz was the first game I created and released on Android and Google Play Store.
                            I was 16 at the time and was in School final year when I decided to make a game in Unity Game Engine.
                            I started learning Unity not so long before when I started developing this game, So the making of this game was actually my learning path.<br><br>
                            Star Ballz is a physics puzzle arcade in which you draw lines to direct the ball to smash star. It has variety of Game Modes for you to enjoy.
                            The game also has some unique types of level and gameplay mechanics. The main aim of the game is to draw physics simulated lines which directs the ball
                            towards a direction and by using this you have to direct the ball to an object named Star to complete the level. <br><br>
                            The initial release of Star Ballz contained only 2 game modes and 40 difficult levels, but I guess the difficulty curve was to steep, So I made a huge
                            update for the game few months later with introduction of new and amazing things.<br><br>

                        <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
                            Bully Us was a game very heavily Inspired from Among Us. In fact, It was basically Among Us with School Theme.
                            I did play the party game mafia before and Among Us is just like a Mafia game with space theme. 
                            So yeah! Enjoyed that lot and thought about making a game like this.<br><br>
                            It was my first ever time I worked on a Multiplayer game, So with help from youtube and Youtube Channels such as "Tom Weiland",
                            I was able to setup my own Dedicated Server. The game was only meant for Youtube and Personal Enjoyement so I didn't invested a lot of time.
                            The game was completed in 3 weeks with all assets made from scratch by me.<br><br>
                            Bully Us revolves around similar concept as Among Us, but instead of Imposters there are Bullies with only aim to Vandalise School Property
                            and beating the hell out of other students. And the rest Innocent students have to complete some tasks and fix the mess made by Bullies.
                            Also to make things interesting I added a security guard who roams the school on night and everyone have to avoid him.
                            Also if he sees anything fishy, all students are called for Meeting where someone has to go (Don't ask where!).<br><br>
                            About the Development of game I went for the similar art style like Among us Devs Innersloth, I was huge fan of Stickman Henry games made by them.
                            And I also made other types of tasks such as Playing Drums, Maths and stuff.<br>
                            You can watch the Devlog for more Info.

                        <p>
                            Well, First I made a Video Animation Parody where a Dev is fighting a Stick Figure in Unity Game Engine,
                            very heavily inpired by Alan Becker's "Animation vs Animator" (I loved those videos as a kid).<br>
                            Also on that Video on youtube somebody commented "Can you make a game like this", and I quite liked the Challenge.<br><br>
                            So I wanted to make a game where you are normally Operating Windows, but something is wrong and eventually you are fighting a Stickman.<br>
                            It's also has some kind of lore attached to it,So I won't be telling more about the Story as it would count as Spoiler!. I think this was my first time making a Story Progression game.<br><br>
                            So the Biggest Challenge was to recreate Windows in Unity Game Engine and also make it looke Believable, which took a lot of time,
                            But I finally did it, atleast Maximum part, rest I just indroduced some kind of custom error popups which I think kind of fits into the story,
                            so wasn't a big of a Deal (totally didn't Slacked off). Then I made various types of Interaction with the Stickman,<br>

                        <p>
                            Monke Together Strong was a game made for Brackeys Game Jam 2021.<br><br>
                            So the Task of the Jam was to make a game in one week, and the Theme was "Stronger Together".
                            Although there was 7 days to complete the game but I totally missed the first 2 days, So i was only left rest 5 Days,
                            but in the end it Worked out Pretty Good, and I was Happy for what I have Created,
                            and that's what Game Jams are, to constantly Torture yourself and Deprive yourself of Sleep but you can learn a lot of things.
                            (Also never participating again).<br><br>
                            When I first the heard the theme, I tried to brainstorm ideas, but don't know why just kept on thinking about Monkeys, 
                            So I made the game Monke Together Strong.<br>
                            In this game there are 5 Monkeys each with their Special Unique Abilities and one Monkey is unable to complete a level, 
                            So they have to Work Together in order to Finish the game.<br>
                            The game is a 2d Platformer with some Interesting Puzzles and you can know more about this by watching Devlog on left side.<br><br>
                            You can Try the Game yourself from the Link above

                            So I started making a a 2D Pixel Game.<br>
                            The sole reason of starting this Game was my liking of the Pixel Art, those Retro Pixel games makes me Nostalgiac, 
                            So I also wanted to make one.<br><br>
                            I decided to make this a Survival RPG kinda Game something like the combination of Stardew Valley and Minecraft.
                            The game will have an Infinite Procedurally generated World, and you can build things, Do Stuff and Yeah all those Sandbox things.<br>
                            Also the game will be a Multiplayer one.<br><br>
                            This is my Second Big Project (After the Endless Runner) which I am working on side by side with Another Projects.
                            It's my one of the Mainstream Project, So it will take some time to develop, but don't worry It will be Completed (99.9% Sure), 
                            So Stay Tuned by watching Progress on this Game.<br><br>

                            Same Repetition of Level Segments and just Running and Dodging, But this Game is a Different Story.<br>
                            Speaking of Story, it's actually a Story Game and I am making this Game kind of a Story Adventure Runner, where you can do Cool Parkour Moves,
                            Enemies, Traps and a lot of Great Stuff<br><br>
                            The main Idea of the Game is that you as a Protagonist will be able to Travel around the World, and the rest of the things will be clear
                            when the Game comes out, Otherwise it would count as a Spoiler!.<br><br>
                            This game is also being developed side by side by the Pixel Survival Game, I am working on two different games at same time because
                            it makes development more fun, it's like when you are bored with one type of game and you want to make something different, So whenever I don't 
                            feel like working on this Title, I can work on others. (maybe it's just my way of Procrastinating).<br><br>
                            Anyways if you want to know more about this Project, You can watch Devlogs on my Channel, also Playlist on the Left.

                        <p style="margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
                            The concept of Time Travelling is very interesting and also Confusing,
                            But how can this be achieved in a Game.<br><br>
                            Well Time Travelling can be an integrated part of the story or the lore of the game,
                            which you can show by just changing the world, objects, and all that things.<br>
                            But wouldn't this be interesting to make everything around you gets reversed over time
                            which you can just watch the changes happening in front of you.<br><br>
                            Well that's Time Manipulation, So I made a mechaninsm for maybe my future games where everything
                            around the Player get's reversed back in time.<br><br>
                            If you want to know how I did this, You can check the video on the Left Side.

                        <p style="margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
                            The Concept of this Project was to make a Generic Player Controller which works for every Character in the Game<br><br>
                            And you can also change the character in runtime by aiming towards any player,<br>
                            Something like a ghost who is trying to possess people around it.<br><br>
                            There's an Idea of making a Multiplayer game by this mechanism which I will work on soon.But for now this is what I made,
                            I tried to make it as seamless as possible just like a spirit who is trying to possess an NPC.<br><br>
                            You can watch the Devlog which Explains how I made this and I hope you you find it interesting.<br><br>
