                    <p>
                        My name is Hemang Chauhan. I am an University Student doing Computer Science in India. I am very passionate for Playing and Developing Games.
                        I started when I was still in School. As everyone who starts in Game Dev, I also tried to make a AAA RPG kind of Game, But realized soon it's not gonna work.
                        And due to that fact I started learning Blender for 3d Modelling, Animation, Texturing at initial stages. Then after tinkering with Unreal Engine and Unity, 
                        I finally started making a small 2d game in Unity Game Engine and after around 3 months of development I released it on Play Store (Star Ballz).<br><br>
                        From that point onwards, I am working solo making various small games and some Big Indie Titles. I am also doing my Computer Science simultaneosly, 
                        so I am not able to give my full time to Game Dev.<br>
                        I also run a Youtube Channel called "AeroBlizz", where I posts Devlogs and also do other kind of things such as Animation, Music Production, Parodies, Art,
                        Tutorials etc. I really enjoy making Content for the people and I also love Editing, Compositing and all that kind of stuff.<br>
                        I have been doing Game Dev for almost 3 Years and in that Journey I have learned a lot of things. Most of the things I learned is from Youtube,
                        from the Channels such as Brackeys, Blackthornprod, Code Monkey and all the Amazing fellows.<br><br>
                        My favourite types of Games are Action-Adventure, Story, Simulation, RTS, RPG and Shooting Games, but generally I enjoy playing every Genre and making them.<br><br>
                        
                        I think that the most important thing for a game is the "Feel of the Game", All the other aspects of the game ultimately contributes to the feel, such as
                        The Setting, Graphics, Map creates the atmosphere of the Game. It's the feel that make players submerged into the game, So I make sure that my games
                        should convey the feelings to it's fullest to the User. That's my Excellence Mantra for a Good Game.
